# Dotfiles

_My personal config files_

This is a repository I use to track some configuration files I use on most
machines. It comes with a basic `install-files.sh` that sets up my
configuration files on new machines, or updates them when changes are made.
There is also a script `configure-git.sh` that applies some basic `git`
configuration.

# Installation

1. Run `./install-files.sh`
2. If desired, run `./configure-git.sh`
3. Make sure to restart the shell, for example by `exec zsh`
