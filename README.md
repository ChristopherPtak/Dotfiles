# Dotfiles

_My personal config files_

This is a repository I use to track some configuration files I use on most
machines. It comes with a basic `install.sh` that sets up my configuration
on new machines, or updates it when changes are made.

# Installation

1. Run `sh install.sh`

2. Make sure to restart the shell, for example by `exec zsh`
