# Dotfiles

_My personal config files_

This is a repository I use to track some configuration files I use on most
machines. It comes with a basic script `install-dotfiles` that sets up my
configuration files on new machines, or updates them when changes are made.

Be warned that these configuration files currently expect the default for
debian bullseye. They may not work as intended on other operating systems. A
future version of these files may include more comprehensive options, so that
they may be used in a more platform-independent manner.
